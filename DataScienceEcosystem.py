# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
#     1. Python
#     2. R
#     3. Julia
#     4. Java
#     5. C ++

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Caret
# 2. Pandas
# 3. NumPY
# 4. ggplot2
# 5. Scikit-learn
# 6. TensorFlow

# The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development environment open source tools used in data science.

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[4]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[5]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{hours:.1f} hours")
